# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 
 The purporse was to assist Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district. We were tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. We helped Maria analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores.
 
 ## Analysis
 My first take away was that charter schools slightly performed better than public schools in reading and math. We would have to deeper dive with the data to see the reason for that. It could many factors like demographics, income, funding, etc.!

My last take away is that on average, public schools receive a big budget than charter schools. This could be based on the fact that public school taking on more students and tend to have bigger buildings. But I would like to take a deeper dive on how budgeting is being alocated. What each type of school iinvesting their budgeting money on? Are charter schools using that budgeting money to invest in better quality of learning, like buying books or paying teachers more? Is that leading to better reading and math scores? This needs to be investigated further so that get a better understanding of the data.

## Conclusion
We need to perform a deeper analysis on the both curriculums and understand why charters schools are performing better accross the board with less budgeting. If the you break down the data further by grades, you can see that charters schools are performing better in math but public schools are getting higher reading scores. We can use this data to see how we can combine the math and reading curriclums so that both charter and public schools are getting similar scores.
